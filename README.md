# E-health-project
Hi, this is a website project called E-health. I made this project using Wordpress.

The main idea for creating this website is to help those people who want to know what kind of exercises they need to do after today's diet.

This website allows users to enter their daily energy intake, and some basic physical details, and then provide them a customized plan of what kind of exercise they should do, how to do the specific exercise, the location of the gym where the users may want to go, and some information about the gym(Prices, environment...)

Since I'm not a nutritionist, nor an expert in doing exercise, so the algorithm I created wasn't entirely correct. And I would like to allow more information from the users to be entered in order to analyze the data and give a more accurate result.

This project was a school project, some of my teammate did an extremely crappy job, so the status of the whole project was not perfect, I have to cut down many features so that I can meet the deadline. But still, I managed to get a positive feedback from the stakeholders.
